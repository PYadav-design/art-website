      <summary><strong>Nike Jordans OG</strong></summary>
      <p>This artwork is a study in pop art culture, where I highlight my oil pastel skills featuring the Nike Air Jordans 1 against a vibrant nature background. Using a palette of deep reds, bright blues, lush greens, warm oranges, and sunny yellows, I blended colors to capture the essence of these culturally iconic shoes. While applying line mark-making to further elevate it in being creative and iconic to Michael Jordan. The striking visuals reflect both their bold design and their connection to urban culture, dynamically bridging fashion and art, which reflects my skill in designing pop art while being detailed in my art.

    <details>
      <summary><strong>Aztec Animals</strong></summary>
      <p>This piece showcases my application of the repousse technique on aluminum, where I skillfully pushed and shaped the material to create designs inspired by various Aztec animals and birds. To enhance the work, I coated the aluminum with black acrylic paint and gently buffed it with a damp cloth, allowing for the intricate details to stand out. This finishing touch not only elevated the piece but also connected it more closely to the rich artistic culture of the Aztecs. Through this artwork, I demonstrate my ability to manipulate physical materials to create truly unique creations.
