      <figcaption>Nike Jordans OG: A vibrant depiction of the iconic sneakers, capturing their cultural significance and timeless design. This artwork is a study in pop art culture, where I highlight my oil pastel skills featuring the Nike Air Jordans 1 against a vibrant natural background. Using a palette of deep reds, bright blues, lush greens, warm oranges, and sunny yellows, I blended colors to capture the essence of these culturally iconic shoes. While applying line mark-making to further elevate it in being creative and iconic to Michael Jordan. 
        The striking visuals reflect both their bold design and their connection to urban culture, dynamically bridging fashion and art, which reflects my skill in designing pop art while being detailed in my art. </figcaption>

      <figcaption>City with Potential: An imaginative cityscape highlighting urban growth and architectural innovation. The use of geometric shapes and varied perspectives aims to create a very visually engaging and abstract representation of urban environments through the use of graphite pencils and blending sticks. 
        The shading, line work, and perspective drawing inspiration: Cubism and the dynamic settings of founding comic book art inspired the distorted and fragmented appearance. </figcaption>

      <img src="black and white glass of water.png" alt="Noir Glass of Water" />
      <figcaption>Noir Glass of Water: A minimalist black and white composition emphasizing simplicity and elegance through everyday objects. This piece is a study of a white charcoal drawing, depicting a glass of water with visible bubbles and reflections against a dark background. The contrast between the bright, detailed glass and the dark backdrop highlights the play of light and shadow, creating a serene atmosphere. Which I implemented through shading, reflection rendering, contrast enhancement with blending the white charcoal. 
        This artwork demonstrates my proficiency with charcoal as a medium and my ability to capture intricate details and subtle lighting effects.</figcaption>
